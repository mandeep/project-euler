Project: Project Euler - Problem 32: Pandigital Products
Author: Mandeep Bhutani
Date: 12/25/2015

Problem:
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; 
for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital. The product 7254 is unusual, as the 
identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

Analysis: 
From the problem, we are able to deduce that the product will be four numbers in length.
The only multiplicands and multipliers to produce this product are a single digit number multiplied by a
quadruple digit number and a double digit number multiplied by a triple digit number.
