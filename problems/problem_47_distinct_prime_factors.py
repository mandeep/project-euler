Title: Project Euler - Problem 47: Distinct Prime Factors
Author: Mandeep Bhutani
Date: 12/26/2015

Problem:
The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 × 7
15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 2² × 7 × 23
645 = 3 × 5 × 43
646 = 2 × 17 × 19.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors.
What is the first of these numbers?
