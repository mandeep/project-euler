Title: Project Euler - Problem 46: Goldbach's Other Conjecture
Author: Mandeep Bhutani
Date: 12/26/2015

Problem:
It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2×12
15 = 7 + 2×22
21 = 3 + 2×32
25 = 7 + 2×32
27 = 19 + 2×22
33 = 31 + 2×12

It turns out that the conjecture was false.
What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
