Project: Project Euler - Problem 49: Prime Permutations
Author: Mandeep Bhutani

Problem: The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms
increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are
prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.
There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes,
exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.
What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this
sequence?
